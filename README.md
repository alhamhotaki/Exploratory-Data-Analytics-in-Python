## Dataset

> PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a study conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that aims to evaluate education systems worldwide by assessing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students. PISA data can provide insight into various aspects of student performance, including their performance in mathematics, reading, and science, as well as their socio-economic background, and parents level of education.
The file provided for this study, pisa2012.csv, contains data from a total of 485'490 students grouped in 636 columns. 

## Summary of Findings

>**1. It appears that there is no relationship between the use of ICT at home or the use of entertainment ICT at home and the academic performance of students in these subjects. Despite the notion that spending more time watching TV or using video games at home may negatively impact students' performance in school, our data suggests that any correlation between the two is minimal. However, it is still important to consider the impact of these activities on students' physical and mental health.**

>**2. It seems that male students consistently outperform female students in the subject of mathematics.
In contrast, female students typically outperform their male counterparts when it comes to reading.
Both student groups perform about equally well in the subject of science.
When all three subjects are considered, it seems that female students perform marginally better than male students.
This seems to show that while men and women are equally capable of understanding science, they may have different aptitudes for mathematics and reading.**

>**3. An intriguing discovery that can be made from analysing PISA data is the correlation between a student's immigration status and their academic performance. Research has revealed that, generally speaking, students from immigrant families tend to perform less well in mathematics, reading, and science than their native-born peers. However, a closer examination of the data reveals some nuances in this trend.
For instance, it has been found that second-generation immigrant students - those who are born in the host country to immigrant parents - tend to perform better in mathematics than both first-generation immigrant students and native-born students. In reading, their performance is slightly equivalent to that of native students, while in science, native students tend to perform better. On the other hand, first-generation immigrant students tend to perform the least in all three subjects, compared to native and second-generation immigrant students.
This information highlights the importance of considering the specific experiences and circumstances of immigrant students, rather than making broad generalisations about their performance. It also suggests that, over time, as immigrants and their children become more acculturated and integrated into their host societies, their academic performance tends to improve.**

>**4. An interesting finding that can be obtained from the data is the relationship between family wealth and student performance. For example, it is assumed that students from wealthy families tend to perform better than students from less wealthy families. While the data indicates that despite having a narrow positive correlation, this factor is not a key element for the success of students.
Moreover, this relationship can vary depending on gender; in some cases, it is found that boys tend to benefit more from their family's wealth than girls, and vice versa.**

>**5. An interesting finding that is obtained from PISA data is the relationship between cultural possessions and student performance. For example, data has shown that students who have access to more cultural possessions such as books, music, art or other cultural materials tend to perform better especially in Reading than students who have less access to these resources. It also showed that female student are more tend to have such cultural possessions at home than male students.**

>**6. Another key insight that can be gleaned from PISA data is the relationship between a student's country of residence and their academic performance. It has been observed that there is a correlation between where a student lives and how they fare in the areas of mathematics, reading, and science. Interestingly, it has been found that none of the major European economies are among the top-performing countries in PISA, while the top-10 list is primarily dominated by East Asian nations.
This information highlights the variations in educational systems and policies between different countries, and how these can impact student performance. It also suggests that certain regions of the world, such as East Asia, have been successful in implementing effective educational policies and practices that lead to high levels of student achievement. It is worth noting that this finding is not conclusive, as it depends on the year of the data and the PISA cycle.**

>**7. The PISA data suggests that a large proportion of mothers have completed either general or vocational upper/post-secondary education. In terms of fathers, it appears that the majority have similar levels of education as their mothers, with a slightly lower percentage of fathers having no education compared to mothers. This indicates a strong correlation between the education levels of each parent. Additionally, the data shows that mothers and fathers who have completed ISCED 5A,6 and ISCED 3A,4 education levels have the greatest impact on the success of students in mathematics, reading, and science.**
